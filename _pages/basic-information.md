Interaction between fluid and a human-made structure or device is design critical in a wide range of engineering disciplines. When designing bridges, cars, wind turbines and when optimising electronics cooling, ship hulls etc. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software is becoming an ever more important design tool. CFD enables faster design loop iteration by detailed flow analysis in or around a proposed design in a virtual environment.

This course is an introduction to CFD using OpenFOAM® which is the most widely used open source toolkit for CFD. The fact that OpenFOAM® is open source makes it extremely versatile allowing the user to modify any aspect of the code to his/her needs. While large scale simulations with commercial CFD software can be extremely expensive due to license fees, OpenFOAM® can be run on massively parallel HPC’s at no additional cost.

## About the course lecturers

### Johan Jønby

I have 10 years of experience as a user and developer of OpenFOAM® technology. I have specialised in numerical methods for interfacial flows, ocean wave simulation and fluid-structure interaction. I am member of the OpenFOAM® Technical Committee for Marine Applications and contribute actively to OpenFOAM at [develop.openfoam.com](https://develop.openfoam.com). For more information about my work visit [roenby.com](https://www.roenby.dk).

### Jakob Hærvig
I have worked with OpenFOAM® actively since 2013 and supervise approximately 15 students per year on master level in OpenFOAM related projects. In my own research I focus on numerical simulations of particle-laden flows involving both adhesive and non-adhesive particles as well as heat transfer applications. I am a board member of the Danish Society for Industrial Fluid Dynamics (DANSIS), which helps to coordinate national efforts in fluid dynamics.
