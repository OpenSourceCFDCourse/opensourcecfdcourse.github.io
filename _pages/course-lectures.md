## Course lectures

### Johan Rønby
I have 10 years of experience as a user and developer of OpenFOAM® technology. I have specialised in numerical methods for interfacial flows, ocean wave simulation and fluid-structure interaction. I am member of the OpenFOAM® Technical Committee for Marine Applications and contribute actively to OpenFOAM at [develop.openfoam.com](https://develop.openfoam.com). For more information about my work visit [roenby.com](https://www.roenby.com).

### Jakob Hærvig
I have worked with OpenFOAM® actively since 2013 and supervise approximately 15 students per year on master level in OpenFOAM related projects. In my own research I focus on numerical simulations of particle-laden flows involving both adhesive and non-adhesive particles as well as heat transfer applications. I am a board member of the Danish Society for Industrial Fluid Dynamics (DANSIS), which helps to coordinate national efforts in fluid dynamics.
