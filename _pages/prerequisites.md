Participants should have basic knowledge of how to navigate using a Linux terminal before attending the course. We will hand out exercises for you to complete prior to the course to familiarize yourself with it. This is not mandatory but strongly encouraged.

Participants are required to set aside time to install the provided software before the course begins. This may take several hours and should be done at least a few days in advance for us to be able to help you if complications arise. Detailed installation instructions will be provided to the participants and installation support will be provided in the weeks prior to the course via a Discord forum. During the course we will not have time to help with installation issues. It will be very hard to follow the course without a working installation at Day 1.
