##Why learn CFD?

Interaction between fluid and a human-made structure or device is design critical in a wide range of engineering disciplines. When designing bridges, cars, wind turbines and when optimising electronics cooling, ship hulls etc. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software is becoming an ever more important design tool. CFD enables faster design loop iteration by detailed flow analysis in or around a proposed design in a virtual environment.

##Why learn OpenFOAM?

This course is an introduction to CFD using OpenFOAM® which is the most widely used open source toolkit for CFD. The fact that OpenFOAM® is open source makes it extremely versatile allowing the user to modify any aspect of the code to his/her needs and set up fully automated work flows for the design proces. While large scale simulations with commercial CFD software can be extremely expensive due to license fees, OpenFOAM® can be run on massively parallel HPC’s at no additional cost.
